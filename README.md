# option-pricing
This Python code simulates and calculates the price of a European call option using two approaches: the analytical Black–Scholes formula and a numerical Monte Carlo simulation. The Monte Carlo method generates many possible future stock prices under a stochastic model, computes the payoff for each path, and averages them to estimate the option price, while the Black–Scholes formula provides an exact benchmark. The script also demonstrates convergence of the Monte Carlo method by increasing the number of simulated paths and calculates a 95% confidence interval for the Monte Carlo estimates, allowing for comparison of accuracy against the analytical solution.
